<h1>Now Page</h1>

<div class="container">
    <p>This is my now page. It's based off of <a href="https://nownownow.com/">NowNowNow</a>. But really I'm sick of getting together with family and friends after a long time and being asked "What's new?" and only only responding "Same old stuff." This page should be a reflection of what I've most recently been thinking about that can hopefully be interesting to other people.</p>

    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p>The upstairs shower drain leaked into the ceiling above the laundry room. I need to figure out how to plumb around a floor joist and clean that all back up.</p>
    <p>I recently bought a new truck that I'm excited about. I want to get it fixed up to my liking and learn how to tow some of the big stuff.</p>

    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>The ABB robot weld cell was recently delivered. I'm currently working on designing and building the fixturing. We need to figure out how to get it installed and set up, learn how to use it, and get it ready for production work.</p>
    <p>I'm also curently going back to school for Electrical Automation at UVU.</p>

<h1>Now Page</h1>

<div class="container">
    <p>This is my now page. It's based off of <a href="https://nownownow.com/">NowNowNow</a>. But really I'm sick of getting together with family and friends after a long time and being asked "What's new?" and only only responding "Same old stuff." This page should be a reflection of what I've most recently been thinking about that can hopefully be interesting to other people.</p>

    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p>The upstairs shower drain leaked into the ceiling above the laundry room. I need to figure out how to plumb around a floor joist and clean that all back up.</p>
    <p>I recently bought a new truck that I'm excited about. I want to get it fixed up to my liking and learn how to tow some of the big stuff.</p>

    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>I'm still working on the fixturing for the welding robot.</p>
    <p>I'm working on getting set up for a big job with over 90 custom panels.</p>
